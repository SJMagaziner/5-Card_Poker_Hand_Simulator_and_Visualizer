# Python Final Project-Samuel Magaziner

### Background

##### An often discussed element of computer science is the nature of programmed randomness.  What is "true" randomness?  Are there innate biases constructed when designing inherently ordered algorithms to mimic random events?  This project was developed to perhaps scratch at the surface of these questions.

##### I am fan of poker and card games in general.  A standard deck of cards contains 52 unique cards spread across 13 ranks (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) each in 4 suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs).  Were on to draw 5-cards from the top of a standard deck there are 2,598,960 possible combinations.  As playing cards are in essence a visual representation of statistics and randomness at play, I settled on developing a project focused on poker hand simulation, classification, analysis, and visualization.
